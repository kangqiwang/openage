"""
Implements the Observer design pattern. Observers can be
notified when an object they observe (so called Observable)
changes.

The implementation is modelled after the Java 8 specification
of Observable ad Observer.

Observer references are weakrefs to prevent objects from being
ignored the garbage collection. Weakrefs with dead references
are removed during notification of the observers.
